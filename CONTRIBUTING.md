- Reproducible [bug reports](https://github.com/vrana/adminer/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) are warmly welcomed.
- [Feature requests](https://github.com/vrana/adminer/issues/new?template=BLANK_ISSUE) are also fine but I'm quite picky about what to accept to Adminer. Please don't be offended if I close the issue as Not Planned, especially if it can be achieved with a plugin.
- [Pull requests](https://github.com/vrana/adminer/pulls) both for bugs and simple features are also fine. Before doing anything more complicated, get familiar with [Adminer philosophy](/developing.md).
